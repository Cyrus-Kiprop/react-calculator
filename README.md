<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![](./images/product-screenshot.gif)

A simple React Calculator with basic to advanced mathematical operations.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live Demo

Click [ here ](https://nxt-gen-calculator.herokuapp.com/) for a live demo of the app.

### Built With

The project was built using the following languages stacks:

```sh
Back-End(server)
```

N/A

```sh
Front-End(client)
```

- [Bootstrap v 4](https://getbootstrap.com)
- React.js
- Javascript/ES6
- Create-react-app (scaffolding the project)
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)

```sh
Testing Frameworks

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - [command line tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
  - [a free account](https://id.heroku.com/)
- git
- Node.js
- create-react-app

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Cyrus-Kiprop/react-calculatort
```

2. CD into the project root directory

```sh
cd ./react-calculator
```

3. Install npm packages

```sh
yarn
```

4. Set the databases

### Deployment

Check out this awesome documentation for heroku deployment: https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage


### Some useful scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```JS
yarn start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

```JS
http//localhost:3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```JS
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```JS
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```JS
yarn eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
